      <h2>🔍 Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) is a creator-centric, black-box approach for improving how a source site is surfaced
        inside answers produced by generative engines (GEs). Instead of chasing traditional web rankings, GEO optimizes the
        <em>content itself</em> so it is more quotable, citable, and extractable by GEs. At Rooms To Go (RTG), I adapted this
        framework to audit our current visibility, run controlled simulations, and ship content guidelines that increase our
        likelihood of being cited.

      <h2>📚 Research Background (KDD 2024)</h2>
      <p>
        The GEO framework formalizes GE visibility as a black-box optimization problem—input: original page content; output: revised
        content that earns more (and higher-ranked) citations in GE responses. The paper introduces custom visibility metrics beyond
        classic SEO and shows that targeted edits can materially improve inclusion and prominence. Reported lifts are typically in the
        <strong>20–40%</strong> range, with effectiveness varying by domain and query type. Tactics like <strong>keyword stuffing</strong>
        underperform or even hurt visibility, while edits that improve <strong>quotability, specificity, and fluency</strong> tend to help.
      </p>

      <h2>🛠 Methods</h2>

      <h3>Phase 1 — Audit &amp; Benchmark</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Built a query set emphasizing real shopping intents (price, style, material, space constraints).</li>
        <li>Logged engine, prompt, answer snippet, <strong>inclusion</strong> (cited/not), <strong>position</strong> (rank in answer),
            and <strong>salience</strong> (how much of our text is quoted/summarized).</li>
        <li>Profiled competitors most frequently cited (Wayfair, IKEA, The Spruce, Target, etc.).</li>
      </ul>

    <section>
      <h2>🚀 Recommendations</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Make pages quotable:</strong> add one-sentence highlights and stat boxes per product/category.</li>
        <li><strong>Codify specs:</strong> ensure dimensions, materials, power features, and warranty are explicit.</li>
        <li><strong>Cite where relevant:</strong> standards/certifications improve verifiability.</li>
        <li><strong>Upgrade schema:</strong> Product + Review + FAQ + LocalBusiness.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitor quarterly:</strong> rerun the benchmark; expand queries as engines evolve.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>🧠 Lessons Learned</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>GEO shifts the goal from ranking to <em>being cited inside the answer</em>.</li>
        <li>Quotability, specificity, and fluency matter more than keyword density.</li>
        <li>Effectiveness varies by domain—treat GEO as an iterative, measured process.</li>
      </ul>
