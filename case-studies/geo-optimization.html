      <h2>🔍 Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) is a creator-centric, black-box approach for improving how a source site is surfaced
        inside answers produced by generative engines (GEs). Instead of chasing traditional web rankings, GEO optimizes the
        <em>content itself</em> so it is more quotable, citable, and extractable by GEs. At Rooms To Go (RTG), I adapted this
        framework to audit our current visibility, run controlled simulations, and ship content guidelines that increase our
        likelihood of being cited.

      <h2>📚 Research Background (KDD 2024)</h2>
      <p>
        The GEO framework formalizes GE visibility as a black-box optimization problem—input: original page content; output: revised
        content that earns more (and higher-ranked) citations in GE responses. The paper introduces custom visibility metrics beyond
        classic SEO and shows that targeted edits can materially improve inclusion and prominence. Reported lifts are typically in the
        <strong>20–40%</strong> range, with effectiveness varying by domain and query type. Tactics like <strong>keyword stuffing</strong>
        underperform or even hurt visibility, while edits that improve <strong>quotability, specificity, and fluency</strong> tend to help.

      <h2>🌟 Objectives</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Measure RTG’s inclusion and prominence in GE answers across shopping-intent queries.</li>
        <li>Identify content gaps vs. top-cited competitors and map them to GEO edit types.</li>
        <li>Ship scalable edit guidelines and schema upgrades to raise citation rate.</li>

      <h2>🛠 Methods</h2>

      <h3>Phase 1 — Audit &amp; Benchmark</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Built a query set emphasizing real shopping intents (price, style, material, space constraints).</li>
        <li>Logged engine, prompt, answer snippet, <strong>inclusion</strong> (cited/not), <strong>position</strong> (rank in answer),
            and <strong>salience</strong> (how much of our text is quoted/summarized).</li>
        <li>Profiled competitors most frequently cited (Wayfair, IKEA, The Spruce, Target, etc.).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Phase 3 — Structure &amp; Monitoring</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Schema:</strong> reinforce extractability with Product, Review, FAQ, and LocalBusiness schema.</li>
        <li><strong>Tracking:</strong> pre/post runs on the same query set to measure inclusion, position, and salience change.</li>

    <section>
      <h2>🚀 Recommendations</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Make pages quotable (answer-first).</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Add a 1–2 sentence “Key Takeaway” at the top of each product/category page with the main value prop, price/size guardrails, and 1–2 standout specs.</li>
      <li>Use short, liftable lines (supports GEO’s “Quotation Addition”).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Codify specs & stats.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensure core specs are explicit and consistent: dimensions, materials, power features, warranty, review count & rating.</li>
      <li>Add micro-facts that models can quote: “fits 12’×16’ rooms”, “chaise depth 62””, “USB-A & USB-C ports”.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Intent-matching content.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Publish buying guides that mirror the highest-volume intents (e.g., “Top 10 Sectionals Under $1500”, “Best Sleeper Sofas for Small Spaces”).</li>
      <li>Add mini-FAQs per page answering the exact prompts we test (delivery, financing, assembly, care, space fit).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Structured data that aids extraction.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Implement/refresh <em>Product</em>, <em>Review</em>, <em>FAQ</em>, and <em>LocalBusiness</em> schema. Keep values synchronized with the UI.</li>
      <li>Use canonical model numbers and consistent naming to reduce entity ambiguity.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Local & conversion signals.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Strengthen store pages with inventory hints, hours, and nearby availability to win brand+geo prompts.</li>
      <li>Link clearly to <code>/customer-service/delivery</code> and <code>/customer-service/financing</code>; add concise, quotable policy summaries.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Measurement & iteration.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Track: inclusion (cited/not), position in the answer, and salience (text quoted) by query family and engine.</li>
      <li>Run pre/post tests after each content release; expand query sets quarterly as engines evolve.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<div class="callout">
  <strong>Priority rollout (6–8 weeks):</strong>
  Week 1–2: Spec/FAQ blocks on top 20 pages • Week 3–4: Buying-guide pair for sectionals & sleepers • Week 5–6: Schema audit & fixes • Week 7–8: Re-benchmark, report lifts.
</div>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>🧠 Lessons Learned</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>GEO shifts the goal from ranking to <em>being cited inside the answer</em>.</li>
        <li>Quotability, specificity, and fluency matter more than keyword density.</li>
        <li>Effectiveness varies by domain—treat GEO as an iterative, measured process.</li>
      </ul>
